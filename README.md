# Silkroad Bookshop Version 1.0

Bookshop Management System with Console-Based UI in C++

Final Project in Computer Programming 1  
ITC111 (1st year, 1st Semester)

## Overview

Silkroad Bookshop is a console-based bookshop management system designed in C++. This project demonstrates a simple inventory and cart system, managed using temporary arrays. It features separate functionalities for admin and user operations, providing a clear structure for managing books and processing user purchases.

> **Note:** This project uses temporary arrays as a substitute for a database, meaning that data is not persistent between program executions.
